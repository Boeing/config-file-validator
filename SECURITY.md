## Reporting Security Issues

The config-file-validator admins and community take security bugs in the config-file-validator project seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/boeing/config-file-validator/security/advisories/new) tab.

The config-file-validator admins will respond to indicate the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply, the security team will keep you informed of the progress toward a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Please report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module.
